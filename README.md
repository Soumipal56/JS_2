# Basic Operators (Arithmetic, Assignment, Increment, Decrement, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise)
##### Create two numbers a = 10 and b = 3. Perform and log: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b, a % b.
#### Answer: 13, 7, 30, 3.3333333333333335, 1
##### Write: let x = 5; x = x + 3; Now rewrite the same using +=. Do the same for -=, *=, /=.
#### Answer: 
            let x = 5;
            x += 3;
            x -= 3;
            x *= 3;
            x /= 3;
##### let count = 5; Use count++ and log value before and after. Repeat for count--.
#### Answer: 5, 7, 7, 5
##### Compare two values: 5 == "5" and 5 === "5". Observe difference.
#### Answer: 5 == "5" -> not strict. Do not check the type, only the value. 5 === "5" -> strict. Checks both the type and value.
##### Check if 10 is greater than 5, less than 20, and equal to 10.
#### Answer: true, true, true
##### Try logical AND and OR: true && false, true || false, !(true)
#### Answer: false, true, false
##### Predict the result of: (5 > 3 && 10 > 8), (5 > 3 || 10 < 8)
#### Answer: true, true
##### Bitwise (light intro): Evaluate 5 & 1 and 5 | 1. Write result and your observation.
#### Answer: 1, 5. The bitwise &, | are used to perform operations as the numbers are first converted into bits.

# Variable Hoisting in JavaScript
##### Predict output of console.log(b); let b = 10
